# Hello!
Today we're venturing into the world of farts!

## Why Do We Fart?
Belching and flatulence, commonly known as farts, serve a crucial role in our digestive health. When we eat, our bodies digest food and produce gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and hydrogen. Sometimes, these gases escape through the rectum, giving us... farts!

### Interesting Facts about Flatulence
- Farting helps release excess gas from our intestines.
- The average person passes wind approximately 14 times a day.
