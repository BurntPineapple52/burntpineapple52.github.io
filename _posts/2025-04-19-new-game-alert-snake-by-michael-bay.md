Get ready for some explosive fun! I've added a new game to the site: **Snake by Michael Bay**.

It's the classic snake game you remember, but with a slightly more... *intense* twist. Use your arrow keys to navigate, grab the food, and try not to crash.

Play it right here:

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
  <iframe 
    src="/assets/games/snake-by-michael-bay/index.html" 
    width="620" 
    height="500" 
    style="border: 1px solid #ccc;" 
    title="Snake by Michael Bay Game">
    Your browser does not support iframes. You can play the game directly <a href="/assets/games/snake-by-michael-bay/index.html">here</a>.
  </iframe>
</div>

Let me know what high score you get!
