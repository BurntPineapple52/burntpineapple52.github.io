# Don't read this Juicebelly

I saw this wacky video about a guy who biohacks using CRISPR

<iframe width="908" height="511" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4vmHweDC5SY" title="Meet the biohacker using CRISPR to teach everyone gene editing" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I noticed it was 5 years old, so I looked around and it doesn't seem like much has changed.  

There were a handful of other, more recent videos:

Looks like you can still buy a kit for $2,000 USD.  So fucking wacky.  https://www.the-odin.com/genetic-engineering-home-lab-kit/ 

## Another interesting topic, balance! 

I'm a big believer in balance. People need a lot of different things at a lot of different levels.  The better aligned you can get yourself, while still remaining sustainable, the better!  

The Power of Full Engagement by J Loehr and T Shwartz covers this very well imo.  You can get a [good summary here](https://verbaltovisual.com/manage-your-energy-not-your-time/) and on YT.

I think it'd be cool to make an app that can check in on you and help you manage balance like this. 

Interesting crossover in this video
