Working with Gemini 2.5 Pro, I iterated through several approaches to create pure CSS explosion animations. The AI helped me explore different techniques, from simple box-shadow animations to more complex canvas-based effects.

## Animation Showcase

Here are the different explosion variants we created, each with a different approach:

### 1. Basic Pixel Explosion
{% include explosion0.html %}

### 2. Random Particle Spread  
{% include explosion1.html %}

### 3. Box-Shadow Expansion
{% include explosion2.html %}

### 4. Repeating Spark Burst
{% include explosion4.html %}

### 5. Frame-by-Frame Sprite
{% include explosion5.html %}

### 6. JS-Controlled CSS Frames
{% include explosion6.html %}

### 7. Canvas Pixel Animation
{% include explosion7.html %}

### 8. Enhanced Canvas Animation
{% include explosion8.html %}

### 9. Procedural Canvas Explosion
{% include explosion9.html %}

### 10. Single Burst Explosion
{% include explosion10.html %}

### 11. Improved Single Burst
{% include explosion11.html %}

### 12. Color Cooldown Effect
{% include explosion12.html %}

## Development Process

Gemini 2.5 Pro was instrumental in:
- Suggesting different animation techniques
- Optimizing performance for each approach
- Debugging cross-browser issues
- Iterating on visual effects

The key takeaways:
1. **CSS-only** animations work well for simple effects but have limitations
2. **Canvas** provides more control for complex particle systems
3. **Hybrid approaches** (CSS+JS) offer a good balance
4. **Performance** varies significantly between techniques

Try clicking each animation to see it in action! The later versions incorporate more advanced effects like screen shake, glow, and color transitions.
