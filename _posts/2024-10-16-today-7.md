# GoMagic.org is a great site

[GoMagic](https://www.gomagic.org) is a seriously great site to learn the basics of go. Things like securing territory and atari and laddering is super interesting.  Really fantastic resource.  Try Atari Go before you get started with games!

[OGS is a good place to get 9x9 matches pretty fast](https://online-go.com/play)

[Senesi's Library also has a ton of great information](https://senseis.xmp.net/)
