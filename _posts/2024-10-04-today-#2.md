## Maybe they are, I havent seen it yet
Motors don't seem to have "open source designs"

### Really interesting reddit post about motors
[source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Motors/comments/pmopwr/need_some_guidance_with_bldc_motor_design/)

"Ok I have a couple go to's:

This [instructables](https://www.instructables.com/Make-Your-Own-Miniature-Electric-Hub-Motor/) post is a decent summary for beginners, but I can't vouch for it being 100% correct all the time

James Mevey [MS Thesis](https://krex.k-state.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/e3f7aa0b-4833-44e4-9ef0-af09f411baa1/content), absolutely fantastic and includes lots of hand-drawn figures. This is one of the references from the instructables post. Don't be put off by the length, just look through the table of contents and read whatever sections you think are relevant to you. It does start from the very basics, which is nice!

This [textbook](https://www.bavaria-direct.co.za/scheme/calculator/#) by Duane Hanselman also does an excellent job at being accessible. Again, don't be put off by the length, just find what you need in there!

Then, if you want to dig deeper into winding factors and slot/pole selection, check out [this winding scheme calculator](https://www.bavaria-direct.co.za/scheme/calculator/#) which has great visuals and/or this other [winding scheme calculator](https://www.emetor.com/windings/) which has a lot of more info about winding MMF harmonics and such.

I would say about 90% of my foundational knowledge started with the above 5 links- the last 10% came from many other sources where different bits and pieces clicked for me. If you have specific questions along the way, let me know!

All the best and may the (airgap) force be with you.

edit: [bonus blog post](http://scolton.blogspot.com/2009/11/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know.html), again can't vouch for 100% correctness but very easy to understand intro to understanding motor control"
