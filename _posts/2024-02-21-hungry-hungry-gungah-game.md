How to play:

Gungah is one hungry boy, and he'll eat anything you put in his mouth! 

As a Gungah Goon, your assignment is to smash as many well placed food-ish items in the Gungah-maw during your alloted time.

To score points: 

Place foods on to the board to start filling up Gungah's mouth. Each food will add to your total subscribers.

The fuller Gungah's mouth is, the more MMMMMM bonus you earn for this mouthful. 

When Gungah's mouth can't take any more, click the Swallow button! Your Total Subscribers will be added to your Total Viewer score at the top!  

Don't forget to Swallow before the timer runs out!
