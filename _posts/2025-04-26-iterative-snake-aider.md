# Coding with Aider is a Game Changer

Today I built the most ridiculous version of Snake ever in just 30 minutes using [Aider](https://aider.chat/) and Deepseek-v3-0324. The entire process only burned 300k tokens and was completely free thanks to [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)!

## The Joy of AI Pair Programming

Working with Aider was an absolute blast. Instead of getting bogged down in implementation details, I could focus on the fun creative parts:

- Coming up with wacky snake personalities
- Designing over-the-top death animations 
- Adding hilarious speech bubbles
- Creating dramatic wall-avoidance behaviors

The AI handled all the tedious JavaScript/CSS/Canvas work while I focused on the vision. It was like having a super-powered coding partner who never gets tired of my crazy ideas.

## Try the Madness Yourself

Here's the unhinged result of our collaboration:

## Why This Matters

This experience showed me how AI tools can:
- Remove friction from creative coding
- Make experimentation nearly free (0 tokens cost!)
- Keep the focus on ideas rather than syntax
- Enable rapid iteration cycles

I'm excited to see how these tools evolve. If today's free tier is this powerful, imagine what we'll be building in a year!

### Pro Tip
For the best Aider experience:
1. Be specific about what you want
2. Break changes into small steps
3. Don't be afraid to iterate
4. Have fun with it!
