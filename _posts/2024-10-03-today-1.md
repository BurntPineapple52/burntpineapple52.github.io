# Hello! 
I'm gunna start writing down some notes here.  

I can't sleep! It's 1:12AM. Did I workout today? No. I was too sleepy earlier. :D

### Markdown is for lovers
It's the text formatting style that github docs and websites powered by Jekyll (like this one!) use to make doing a lot of website stuff way easier.  Things like updating formatting, and.. uh.. other stuff I don't really remember right now lel. 

[MarkdownGuide.Org](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) is a good resource if you want to learn some markdown.  

### Projects I think would be interesting to work on

**Open Source Hardware project list**
It'd be cool to have an up to date directory of open source projects.  I'm inspired by:
- working for shitty, wasteful companies.
- working with very smart people who love to solve problems
- the success of open source software, both commercially and in personal projects
- existing successfully open hardware projects like:
    - [ExpressLRS](https://www.expresslrs.org/) - aims to provide the best completely open, high refresh radio control link while maintaining a maximum achievable range at that rate with low latency. Vast support of hardware in both 900 MHz and 2.4 GHz frequencies.
    - [OpenIPC](https://openipc.org/) - an open-source operating system targeting IP cameras with ARM and MIPS processors from several manufacturers in order to replace that closed, opaque, insecure, often abandoned and unsupported firmware pre-installed by a vendor.
    - [MPCNC](https://docs.v1e.com/) - The Mostly Printed CNC (MPCNC) is a platform to precisely control motion. This can easily be a milling machine, 3D router, 3D printer, laser cutter, vinyl cutter, CNC plasma cutter, you name it.
    - [PrintNC](https://wiki.printnc.info/en/home) - The PrintNC is a high performance, DIY CNC router. It's based on a steel frame to ensure rigidity and uses 3D printed parts to make assembly easy.
