OMG, you guys, I have to talk about Joni. This kid is, like, objectively the cutest baby EVER. I'm not even kidding. I've seen a lot of babies in my time, but Joni? Joni is next level.

## The Rebellion is Real

Seriously, it's gotten to the point where other babies are staging REBELLIONS against him. Parents are THROWING their perfectly fine NON-JONI babies into the WOODS. WTF is going on?! It's madness I tell you, MADNESS!

## Joni's Cuteness Breakdown

*   His little nose? Perfect.
*   His tiny hands? I can't even.
*   The way he gurgles? Forget about it. I'm DONE.

## President or Supervillain?

I'm pretty sure Joni is going to be president someday, or maybe a supervillain. Either way, the cuteness is a weapon, I swear. Someone needs to nerf this baby STAT.

## Final Thoughts on the Cuteness Overload

But seriously, Joni is frickin' adorable. If you ever get the chance to meet him prepare to be amazed. Prepare to question the cuteness of anyone that you considered cute before him. You will understand that they were not even close.

I'm not responsible for what happens if you see him. You have been warned.

:D :D :D
