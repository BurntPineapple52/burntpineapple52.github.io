# notes
- this time I wanted more focus to be on the visual stylings
- I'm not a super visually creative person, in the sense that I can't draw or paint to save my life.  I do love photography, but that feels slightly different.  Something about the space between the beauty of capturing a moment-in-time vs bringing something that did not exist to life
- Performant visual juice is badass because it lets you do a lot more with less
- it also lets you reach people who normally couldn't play your game! I'd love to see what the hardware distribution of the internet looks like nowadays, but smaller and faster loading games/sites will always be a nicer experience. 
- ok trying to find a practical way to add in these noise effects is... challenging.  I've burned ~30 min tinkering with various things that are useless for now (see space invaders noise effects css png hahaha)
- I just went back to emojis.  Given the enjoyable experience I had working with Gemini 2.5 Pro on those css explosions, I'm going to hold off on focusing too much on generating this stuff 100% within css/js/html5.  Emoji's and opengameart.org baybeeee.
- very fun to add random stuff.  Apologies for the aggressive language again, v3 0324 is angy. 
- still plenty of bugs (text doesn't appear on the playspace near edges, after you die game speed it too fast, etc) and stuff that should be polished, but I'm just going to keep trucking along.
